oDigger Search allows blogs to add an affiliate offers search to their website and to make money off any users referred to networks through the search results.

== Description ==

The oDigger Search plugin allows you to integrate oDigger's affiliate offer search functionality with your site and add a lucrative new income stream to your business. This plugin allows your users to search through 35,000+ affiliate offers and 100+ affiliate networks right from your site and it allows you to collect referral commissions on any users that sign up to a network through your blog.  

Affiliates are constantly researching new offers and opportunities on [http://odigger.com](http://odigger.com) and now then can do it right from your site.  This provides a better user experience for your users since they can search through oDigger's ever growing database of affiliate offers while staying on your blog.  

The oDigger Search plugin also enables your website to make money in a new and lucrative way: you can put your affiliate network referral URL into the search results! This means you earn commissions off any affiliate who signs up to an affiliate network through your search results link. Most affiliate networks offer a lifetime 5% commission of all income earned by any affiliates you refer. If you sign up just 5 heavy hitting affiliates, who earn just a grand a day (there are a lot of them out there), then you're making $250 a day in passive income for life!

Upon installing the oDigger search plugin, it will add a page to your blog where users can perform searches for affiliate programs. You also have the option to add a little sidebar widget with a search field that will take people to your affiliate program search page when people enter search queries. This will help drive traffic to your search feature and get affiliates signing up to networks under your links.

The plugin is free.  So to get oDigger Search functionality and start making money today just download and install it.
